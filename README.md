# QR Codes with Python: A Simple Tutorial
This project shows you how to create your very own QR codes using Python! QR codes are those square barcodes you scan with your phone, and they're super handy for sharing links, Wi-Fi passwords, or any text information quickly.

# What it Does
This small Python program takes a website link (or any text you give it) and turns it into a scannable QR code image. In the example provided, it creates a QR code for the T-Series YouTube channel and saves it as an SVG file.

# Why is This Useful?
Quick Sharing: Instead of typing out long links, people can just scan your QR code.

Offline Access: You can print QR codes on posters, business cards, or anything else to link people to online content.

Learning Project: It's a great way to learn about using external libraries in Python and seeing a practical output!

# How it Works (A Simple Look)
Think of it like a special translator for computers:

You give it text: First, you tell the program what information you want to put into the QR code (like the YouTube link in the example).

It uses a special tool: Python has many "libraries" which are like toolkits. For QR codes, we use a tool called pyqrcode. This tool knows the rules for turning text into the black and white patterns of a QR code.

It draws the QR code: Once pyqrcode figures out the pattern, it can then draw it out as an image. In our example, it saves it as an SVG file, which is a type of image that looks good no matter how much you zoom in!
